            <p>I am an Assistant Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics. Beginning in September 2025, I will be an Assistant Professor of Politics at Princeton University. I was previously a postdoctoral fellow at the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton and received a PhD in political science from Columbia University in 2022.</p>

            <p>I study the political economy of climate change and decarbonization, primarily through the lenses of labor, identity, and bureaucratic politics. My work has appeared in the <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>Journal of Politics</i>, and <i>World Politics</i>. I have provided commentary for outlets including <i>Devex</i>, <i>The Economist</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i>. </p>
