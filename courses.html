        <span class="course-title">POL 385 International Political Economy (Fall 2025)</span>
        
        How do states govern the global economy? How did the modern international economic order emerge? Why is it now under pressure? This course explores the politics of tariffs and trade, money and finance, migration, and climate change. We analyze a range of theoretical approaches for understanding both historical cases and current events. In a series of interactive case studies, students step into the shoes of political leaders contending with real-world policy challenges, learning about the difficult tradeoffs they face and possible paths forward.
