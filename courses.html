        <p>I am teaching the following courses in 2025â€“26:</p>

        <p>
        <span class="course-title">POL 385 International Political Economy (Fall 2025)</span>
        
        How do states govern the global economy? How did the modern international economic order emerge? Why is it now under pressure? This course explores the politics of tariffs and trade, money and finance, migration, and climate change. We analyze a range of theoretical approaches for understanding both historical cases and current events. In a series of interactive case studies, students step into the shoes of political leaders contending with real-world policy challenges, learning about the difficult tradeoffs they face and possible paths forward.
        </p>
        <p>
        <span class="course-title">POL 585 International Political Economy (Spring 2026)</span>
        
        This is a PhD seminar on international political economy, covering foundational scholarship and cutting-edge work from today. It is intended to prepare students for the IR general exam and aid in the development of independent research projects.

        <p>At LSE I taught <span style="font-weight:500">IR x67 Political Economy of Climate Change</span>. This was a research-focused lecture course on the international and comparative political economy of climate change, enrolling both undergraduate and master's students. &nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="docs/irx67_syllabus.pdf" class="inline-button">SYLLABUS</a>

        <p>I am happy to write <span style="font-weight:500">letters of recommendation</span> in support of students' academic and professional endeavors. If you would like me to write such a letter, please ask me at least two weeks before the letter is due. When emailing me to request a letter, please include (1) what the letter is for (i.e., jobs, fellowships, grad school); (2) when the letter is due; (3) how I should submit the letter; (4) your CV/resume; and (5) drafts of your application materials, such as your cover letter and writing sample. For major applications (e.g., grad school applications), it is helpful if you meet with me in office hours well ahead of the deadline to discuss your plans.
    </p>

    <p>Note that I am able to write the strongest letters for students who performed well and actively participated in classes I taught, who frequently met with me in office hours, and/or who worked with me on research as an advisee, collaborator, or RA.</p>
